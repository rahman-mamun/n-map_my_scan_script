# n-map_my_scan_script
Here's a basic example of a `README.md` file for your Git repository, tailored to your network inventory script:

---

# Network Inventory Tool**

This project is a Python-based script to scan and inventory devices on a network. It uses `nmap` for scanning and exports the results to an Excel file for further analysis.



#Features*
- Scans the local network to identify active devices.
- Collects IP addresses, device details, and other network data.
- Saves the output as an Excel file (`network_inventory.xlsx`).

---

#Requirements**
- Python 3.7 or newer
- `nmap` must be installed on the system
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `openpyxl`

#Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-inventory-tool.git
   cd network-inventory-tool
   ```

2. #Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure `nmap` is Installed**:
   Install `nmap` using your system's package manager:
   - macOS: `brew install nmap`
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install nmap`


#Usage**

1. #Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python network_inventory.py
   ```
   The script will scan the network and generate an Excel file named `network_inventory.xlsx`.

2. *Customize the Target Network**:
   You can modify the target network in the script by changing the `nmap` scan parameters. For example:
   ```python
   target = "192.168.1.0/24"
   ```



#Output**

The output file `network_inventory.xlsx` contains:
- IP addresses of scanned devices
- Additional network details (e.g., open ports, device names)
